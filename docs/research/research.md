**What I like**

* Reveals a description, giving you more information and explaining why the answer was correct/incorrect.
* Content is spread out with lots of space which also makes it easier to read.

Beano's quiz is aimed at a younger audience through:

* Bright colours
* Pictures on each question
* Googly eyes on the sharks

**What I like**

* It automatically scrolls the user to the next question.

**What I dislike**

* I think they could've sized the questions/answers better by keeping them within the height of the viewport.

## National Geographic Kids - Quiz Wiz

Beano and natgeokids have a few things in common:

* Bright colours
* Pictures on each question

Natgeokids does have a more interesting theme and it is visually evident that the target audience is children. 

**What I like**

* It shows you how many questions you have answered correctly or incorrectly and how many questions are left.

* It also displays a description after answering a question.
